# Employee Performance Prediction

This project predicts employee performance using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help organizations assess and forecast employee productivity based on various factors such as experience, skills, attendance, and more.

## Overview

The entire project was developed and executed in a **Google Colab notebook** for easy sharing and reproducibility. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Project Features

* Data loading and cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with charts and visualizations
* Feature engineering and selection
* Training multiple ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
* Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
* Model evaluation using classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
* Final model selection based on performance
* Predicting employee performance on new datasets

## How to Run the Project

You can run this project directly on **Google Colab** by following these steps:

1. **Open the Colab Notebook**:
   Click on the provided link to open the notebook in Google Colab.

2. **Run All Cells**:
   Go to `Runtime` > `Run all` to execute all the steps sequentially.

3. **Upload Dataset** (if required):
   If the notebook requires you to upload your own dataset, follow the instructions inside the notebook.

4. **View Outputs and Results**:
   The notebook will output visualizations, metrics, and predictions step-by-step.

## Dependencies

The notebook uses the following Python libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* (Optional) xgboost, lightgbm, or others based on your implementation

These libraries are pre-installed in Colab. If you want to run locally, you can install them via:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
